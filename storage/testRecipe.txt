Mauritian chicken curry
//description
Try this fragrant Mauritian chicken curry with potatoes. It's served with a spiced tomato side dish along with fluffy basmati rice and rotis

//ingredients

2 tbsp vegetable oil
8 curry leaves, finely chopped
1 medium onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely grated


//steps
Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a low-medium heat. Drop in the curry leaves, onion, garlic, ginger, cinnamon stick, chilli and thyme and cook for 5 mins until the onion has softened, stirring regularly to prevent sticking to the pan.

Mix the curry powder with a splash of water in a bowl to make a runny paste. Add the paste to the pan and give it a good stir until aromatic, around 30 seconds. Keeping the heat on a low-medium simmer so that the spices donâ€™t burn, add the chicken pieces and stir to coat in the curry.

Add the chopped tomatoes, potatoes and 1 tsp salt. Pour in water to just below the level of the chicken and potatoes. Cook for around 25 mins until the potatoes and chicken are cooked through, then discard the cinnamon stick.
